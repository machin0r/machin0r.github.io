### Projects
### [WHPSC Race Data Analysis](https://github.com/machin0r/WHPSC_Race_Data)

The World Human Powered Speed Challenge takes place in Nevada each year, and the current world record is 89 mph. In this project I analyse the race data from 2001-2019, creating visualisations for the riders, bikes, and runs. 

I also created two random forest regression models to determine which factors have the biggest influence on the top speed of the riders.
