[WHPSC Race Data Analysis](https://github.com/machin0r/WHPSC_Race_Data)
<img src="/images/portfolio_image.png?raw=true"/>
The World Human Powered Speed Challenge takes place in Nevada each year, and the current world record is 89 mph. In this project I analyse the race data from 2001-2019, creatign visualisation for the riders, bikes, and runs. I also create two random forest regression models to determine which factors have the biggest influence on the top speed of the riders.
