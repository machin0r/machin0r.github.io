### Projects
### WHPSC Race Data Analysis

The World Human Powered Speed Challenge takes place in Nevada each year, and the current world record is 89 mph. In this project I analyse the race data from 2001-2019, creating visualisations for the riders, bikes, and runs. 
I also create two random forest regression models to determine which factors have the biggest influence on the top speed of the riders.
